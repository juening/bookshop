    description:
      "From the star of Bravo's hit reality show Below Deck , comes Running Against the Tide , the \"Stud of the Sea's\" first-ever memoir recounting his journey from landlocked Saginaw, Michigan to the high seas, where he has spent more than twenty-five years as a superyacht captain. The cast members of Below Deck are known for their catfights, scheming, personal attacks, and long-held grudges, but what keeps viewers coming back week after week is resident hero Captain Lee, the only cast member to appear in all five seasons. But you don't have to be one of Below Deck 's 1.5 million weekly viewers to appreciate Captain Lee's story, which offers a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the luxury yachting industry and one of Bravo's biggest franchises. From having to reclaim his drunk captain's lost papers in the Dominican Republic to unwittingly crewing a drug boat out of Turks and Caicos to navigating the outrageous demands of the super-rich in New York City, Captain Lee's tales from the high seas run the gamut, proving time and time again why he's a fan favorite: he's occasionally profane, he's often surprising, but he's never dull and, for the first time, he's here to tell all.",

      "Renowned microbiologist Dr. Martin J. Blaser invites us into the wilds of the human microbiome, where for hundreds of thousands of years bacterial and human cells have existed in a peaceful symbiosis that is responsible for the equilibrium and health of our bodies. Now this invisible Eden is under assault from our overreliance on medical advances including antibiotics and caesarian sections, threatening the extinction of our irreplaceable microbes and leading to severe health consequences. Taking us into the lab to recount his groundbreaking studies, Blaser not only provides elegant support for his theory, he guides us to what we can do to avoid even more catastrophic health problems in the future.",

    description:
      "For political history enthusiasts, this engaging and taut history of post-WWII US foreign policy under President Harry Truman should be a delight. Scarborough’s first-hand knowledge of Washington politics, politicking and his Morning Joe perspective on national and international world events, combine for a dramatic, nuanced telling of Truman’s deft ushering of the nation from isolationism to an active leadership role on the world stage. It is a tale of back-door diplomacy, international cooperation, political persuasion and bipartisan cooperation, with plenty of resonance for today. ",

      "Bestselling and Newbery Medal-winning author Louis Sachar knows how to make readers laugh. And there are laughs galore in perennial favorite Sideways Stories from Wayside School, the first book in the series! Accidentally built sideways and standing thirty stories high (the builder said he was very sorry for the mistake), Wayside School has some of the wackiest classes in town, especially on the thirtieth floor. That’s where you’ll meet Bebe, the fastest draw in art class; John, who only reads upside down; Myron, the best class president ever; and Sammy, the new kid—he’s a real rat.",
